# synthetic phi query framework
Reproducible pipeline and benchmark dataset for generating synthetic PHI-containing clinical queries to evaluate HIPAA-compliant de-identification in AI workflows

**Why This Framework Matters**

Business Associated Agreement (BAA) HIPAA-compliant Large Language Model's (LLM) can process patient data but lack internet search, because adding search risks PHI leakage to external APIs. As physicians increasingly use AI assistants with patient-specific queries, we need deterministic de-identification systems in these future agentic workflows that guarantee zero PHI transmission. Yet obtaining real physician queries containing PHI is virtually impossible: IRB approval is prohibitively complex, commercial BAA HIPAA-compliant LLM providers like Qualified Health won't/can't share physician queries, and manual creation is slow, expensive, and unscalable. This framework solves a fundamental research blocker in clinical ai infromatics research by enabling systematic generation of labeled synthetic queries where every PHI element has ground-truth annotations. This isn't just a benchmark - it's an ethical proxy that advances research in sensitive domains where real data is legally and ethically inaccessible. Developers can trace PHI through Model Context Protocol servers (MCP) implementations, multi-stage pipelines, and agentic search workflows - verifying complete removal at each stage. This framework enables researchers to build confident deployments of HIPAA-compliant AI systems that can safely access current medical knowledge through MCP servers and internet search, while addressing healthcare AI safety requirements that real patient data simply cannot fulfill.
