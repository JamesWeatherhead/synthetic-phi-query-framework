# synthetic phi query framework
Reproducible pipeline and benchmark dataset for generating synthetic PHI-containing clinical queries to evaluate HIPAA-compliant de-identification in AI workflows

**Why This Framework Matters**

BAA HIPAA-compliant LLMs can process patient data but lack internet search - adding search risks PHI leakage to external APIs. As physicians increasingly use AI assistants with patient-specific queries, we need deterministic de-identification systems and agentic workflows that guarantee zero PHI transmission. Yet obtaining real physician queries containing PHI is virtually impossible: IRB approval is prohibitively complex, commercial HIPAA-compliant LLM providers (like Qualified Health in Texas or Open Evidence nationally) won't share query data, and manual creation is slow, expensive, and unscalable. This framework solves a fundamental research blocker by enabling systematic generation of labeled synthetic queries where every PHI element has ground-truth annotations. This isn't just a benchmark - it's an ethical proxy that advances research in sensitive domains where real data is legally and ethically inaccessible. Developers can trace PHI through Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementations, multi-stage pipelines, and agentic search workflows - verifying complete removal at each stage. By preserving essential clinical and privacy characteristics through synthetic generation, this framework enables confident deployment of HIPAA-compliant AI systems that safely access current medical knowledge while addressing healthcare AI safety requirements that real patient data simply cannot fulfill.
