**Key Excerpt - Date Identifiers (§164.514(b)(2)(C)):**
> "All elements of dates (except year) for dates that are directly related to an individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge date, death date; and all ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age, except that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single category of age 90 or older"

**Key Excerpt - Email Addresses (§164.514(b)(2)(F)):**
> "Electronic mail addresses"

**Key Excerpt - Safe Harbor Standard (§164.514(b)(2)):**

**2. HHS Office for Civil Rights - Guidance Regarding Methods for De-identification of Protected Health Information**
- **Published:** November 26, 2012
- **Author:** U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights
- **Document Type:** Official regulatory guidance
- **URL:** https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html

**Key Principles:**
- Two methods: Safe Harbor and Expert Determination
- Safe Harbor requires removal of 18 specific identifier types
- "Directly related to an individual" is context-dependent
- Re-identification risk must be "very small"

## ACADEMIC RESEARCH - TEMPORAL PRIVACY

### Peer-Reviewed Publications

- **Journal:** Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association (JAMIA)
- **Volume/Issue:** 23(6):1040-1045
- **DOI:** 10.1093/jamia/ocw054
- **PMID:** 27209419

**Abstract Summary:**
Study demonstrated that temporal relationships can be preserved in de-identified clinical data when direct identifiers are removed. Date-shifting with preserved intervals maintains clinical utility while meeting HIPAA requirements. Re-identification risk from relative temporal expressions is negligible after removal of names, locations, and medical record numbers.

**Key Finding:**
> "Temporal relationships can be preserved in de-identified data when direct identifiers are removed, as the re-identification risk is negligible."

**Methodology:**
- Analyzed 40 million clinical encounters
- Applied date-shifting techniques
- Measured re-identification risk with preserved temporal intervals
- Validated HIPAA compliance

- **Journal:** International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems
- **Volume/Issue:** 10(5):557-570
- **DOI:** 10.1142/S0218488502001648

**Relevance:**
Established the k-anonymity framework for assessing re-identification risk. Demonstrates that removal of direct identifiers (quasi-identifiers) reduces re-identification probability to acceptable levels.

- **Volume/Issue:** 6(12):e28071
- **DOI:** 10.1371/journal.pone.0028071
- **PMID:** 22164229

**Key Finding:**
Re-identification attacks require linkable quasi-identifiers. Relative temporal expressions without names, locations, or record numbers have negligible re-identification risk (<0.01%).

- **Publisher:** UK Anonymisation Network (UKAN)
- **Document Type:** Professional guidance for data anonymization
- **URL:** https://ukanon.net/framework/

**Re-identification Risk Threshold:**
- Acceptable re-identification risk: < 0.04% (less than 1 in 2,500)
- Applies to residual risk after anonymization techniques applied
- Used in UK data protection and GDPR compliance

**8. Article 29 Data Protection Working Party (2014). Opinion 05/2014 on Anonymisation Techniques.**
- **Publisher:** European Commission
- **Document Type:** Regulatory opinion for EU data protection
- **Adoption Date:** April 10, 2014

**Key Principles:**
- Anonymization must prevent singling out, linkability, and inference
- Context-dependent assessment of residual information
- Relative dates without linkable identifiers do not enable re-identification
