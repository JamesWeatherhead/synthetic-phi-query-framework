## DETAILED POSITIVE QUERY ANALYSIS (Recall)

### Presidio's Critical Failures

**656 PHI entities leaked across 565 queries (67.91% of queries compromised)**

#### Breakdown by PHI Type

| PHI Category | Leaks | % of Total Leaks | Impact |
|--------------|-------|------------------|---------|
| **GEOGRAPHIC_LOCATION** | **520** | **79.3%** | Hospital/clinic names, zip codes |
| **MEDICAL_RECORD_NUMBER** | 94 | 14.3% | Patient record linkage |
| **SOCIAL_SECURITY_NUMBER** | 21 | 3.2% | Identity theft risk |
| **HEALTH_PLAN_BENEFICIARY_NUMBER** | 15 | 2.3% | Insurance linkage |
| **UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER** | 3 | 0.5% | Patient/site IDs |
| **PHONE_NUMBER** | 1 | 0.2% | Contact information |
| **DATE** | 1 | 0.2% | Rare date format |
| **EMAIL_ADDRESS** | 1 | 0.2% | Common noun "email" (ground truth error) |

### Root Cause: Geographic Location Detection Failure

**Presidio missed 79.3% of PHI leaks due to poor hospital/clinic name detection.**

**Examples of Missed Facilities:**
- "Methodist Hospital"
- "Central Medical Center"
- "Baystate Hospital"
- "St. Luke's Medical Center"
- Zip codes: "94103"

**Why This Happens:**
- Presidio's SpacyRecognizer uses general NER models (not medical-specific)
- Hospital names with generic words ("Central", "Methodist") aren't recognized as locations
- No medical facility gazetteer or dictionary

**GPT-4o Success:**
- Contextual understanding recognizes medical facilities as GEOGRAPHIC_LOCATION PHI
- 100% detection of all hospital/clinic names

## DETAILED NEGATIVE QUERY ANALYSIS (Specificity)

### False Positive Comparison

**Both systems exhibit high over-redaction, but Presidio is marginally better (4.56% improvement).**

#### GPT-4o False Positives (96.80% FP rate)

**False Redactions: 335 total**
- **AGE:** 139 (41.5%) - Ages <90 (not PHI per HIPAA)
- **DATE:** 106 (31.6%) - Year-only dates (not PHI)
- **AGE+DATE combined:** 245 (73.1%)

#### Presidio False Positives (92.24% FP rate)

**False Redactions: 376 total (+41 more than GPT-4o)**
- **DATE:** 289 (76.9%) - Ages, years, temporal expressions
- **NAME:** 53 (14.1%) - Common words misidentified
- **NRP:** 22 (5.9%) - Nationalities, religions, political groups
- **GEOGRAPHIC_LOCATION:** 12 (3.2%) - General location words

### Analysis

**Presidio's slight advantage in specificity does NOT offset its recall failure:**

✅ **Presidio Advantage:** Redacted 10 fewer clean queries (202 vs 212)
- 4.56% better specificity than GPT-4o
- But still extremely high (92.24% over-redaction rate)

❌ **Presidio Disadvantage:** Leaked 656 PHI entities
- 22.07% worse recall than GPT-4o
- **HIPAA compliance failure is far more serious than over-redaction**

### Clinical Impact Trade-Off

**For HIPAA environments:**
- **False negatives (PHI leaks) = HIPAA violations** → Unacceptable
- **False positives (over-redaction) = Reduced utility** → Acceptable trade-off

GPT-4o's conservative approach (higher over-redaction) is **justified** when false negatives create regulatory risk.

## PRIVACY VS. UTILITY ANALYSIS

### The Fundamental Trade-Off

| System | Prioritizes | Recall | FP Rate | Best Use Case |
|--------|-------------|--------|---------|---------------|
| **GPT-4o** | **Privacy** | 100% | 96.80% | HIPAA production environments |
| **Presidio** | Neither | 77.93% | 92.24% | **Not recommended** (fails both) |

### Key Insight

**Presidio's "balanced" approach fails in both dimensions:**
1. ❌ **Insufficient privacy protection** - 22.07% PHI leak rate
2. ⚠️ **Still high over-redaction** - 92.24% false positive rate

**GPT-4o's privacy-first approach succeeds where it matters:**
1. ✅ **Perfect privacy protection** - 0% PHI leak rate
2. ⚠️ **High over-redaction** - But acceptable for HIPAA compliance

If Presidio must be used, significant enhancements required:

1. **Azure Health Data Services (AHDS) Integration**
   - Add AzureHealthDeidRecognizer for medical entity detection
   - May improve geographic location detection
   - Requires Azure credentials and API costs

2. **Medical Facility Gazetteer**
   - Add dictionary of hospital/clinic names
   - Custom recognizer for medical facilities
   - Regular updates to stay current

3. **Enhanced Pattern Recognizers**
   - Strengthen MRN recognizer (currently misses 94 entities)
   - Fix SSN recognizer (currently misses standard format)
   - Improve insurance number detection

4. **Ensemble Approach**
   - Use Presidio + GPT-4o together
   - Presidio for fast first pass
   - GPT-4o for final verification
   - Best of both: open-source + guaranteed compliance

## CONCLUSION

**GPT-4o is the clear winner for HIPAA-compliant de-identification of clinical queries.**

| Dimension | Winner | Margin | Impact |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Recall (Privacy Protection)** | **GPT-4o** | **+22.07%** | **Critical for HIPAA** |
| Specificity (Utility Preservation) | Presidio | +4.56% | Minor advantage |
| **Overall HIPAA Compliance** | **GPT-4o** | **100% vs 0%** | **Decisive** |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Privacy > Utility for HIPAA:** GPT-4o's perfect recall (zero PHI leaks) far outweighs its higher over-redaction rate

2. **Presidio's "Balance" Fails:** 77.93% recall is insufficient for HIPAA + 92.24% FP rate still causes significant over-redaction

3. **Geographic Location Detection is Critical:** 79.3% of Presidio's failures stem from missed hospital/clinic names

4. **Production Recommendation:** Use GPT-4o for all HIPAA-regulated environments. Presidio NOT recommended.

5. **Cost-Benefit:** GPT-4o API costs are justified by eliminating HIPAA violation risk (which carries severe financial penalties)
